This repository stores my submissions to GAN specialization offered by Deeplearning.ai through Coursera. 

I have started this specialization in the hopes of understanding more about GANs. The specialization contains 3 Courses,

### 1. Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
In the first course, you will be introduced to the basic GAN and the idea behind a GAN in the week-1, later you will talk about DCGANs in Week-2, followed by WGAN and Conditional GANs.

### 2. Build Better Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
In this course, we will build upon what we have learn in the first course and check where we can improve the performance of a GAN. 

### 3. Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
In this course we will see some famous applications of GANs like the Image translation with Pix2Pix GAN and the Unpaired translation with CycleGAN.
